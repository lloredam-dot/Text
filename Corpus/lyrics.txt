Well, I won't back down
No, I won't back down
You could stand me up at the gates of Hell
But I won't back down
No, I'll stand my ground
Won't be turned around
And I'll keep this world from draggin' me down
Gonna stand my ground
And I won't back down
hey, baby
There ain't no easy way out (I won't back down)
Hey, I will stand my ground
And I won't back down
Well, I know what's right
I got just one life
In a world that keeps on pushin' me around
But I'll stand my ground
And I won't back down
(I won't back hey, baby
There ain't no easy way out 
Hey I will stand my ground 
And I won't back down
(I won't back hey, baby
There ain't no easy way out (
Hey, I won't back down
hey, baby
There ain't no easy way out 
Hey, I will stand my ground 
And I won't back down 
No, I won't back down

Guess it's true
I'm not good at a one night stand
But I still need love
'Cause I'm just a man
These nights never seem to
Go to plan
I don't want you to leave
Will you hold my hand?

Oh, won't you stay with me?
'Cause you're all I need
This ain't love, it's clear to see
But darling, stay with me
Why am I so emotional?
No, it's not a good look
Need some self control
And deep down, I know this never works
But you can lay with me so it doesn't hurt

Oh, won't you stay with me?
'Cause you're all I need
This ain't love, it's clear to see
But darling, stay with me
Oh, won't you stay with me?
'Cause you're all I need
This ain't love, it's clear to see
But darling, stay with me

Oh, won't you stay with me?
'Cause you're all I need
This ain't love, it's clear to see
But darling, stay with me
So darling, stay with me
