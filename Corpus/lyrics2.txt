I used to go out to parties
And stand around
'Cause I was too nervous, baby
To really get down
But my body
Yearned to be free
I got up on the floor and thought
Somebody could choose me
No more standin'
There beside the walls
Finally got myself together, baby
Now I'm havin' a ball
As long as you're groovin'
There's always a chance
Somebody watchin'
Might wanna make romance
Move your body
Ooh, baby, you dance all night
To the groove and
Feel alright
Everybody's groovin'
On like a fool
But if you see me
Spread out and let me in
Baby, just party
High and low
Let me step into
Your erotic zone
Move it up
Turn it 'round
Ooh, shake it down
Oh, baby, oh
You can love me when you want to, babe
This is such a groovy party, baby
We're here face to face
Baby, everybody's swingin'
This is such a groovy place

Geez, movin' your body
Easy with no doubts

You wanna turn me on, hey
Think I'm gonna let you do it, baby

You got to give it up 
Keep on dancin', ooh
